## Major Changes
No major changes expected.

## What I Have Accomplished
Due to my busy schedule this week (two exams and two major assignments due), I didn’t spend a lot of time on my research in the past week. I fixed some issues regarding the testing script, but it’s not bug-free yet.

## Meeting My Milestone
Since I did more than I expected in the first three weeks, I am not behind my milestone.

## Surprises
No surprises encountered.

## Looking Ahead
I will fix the testing script and potential bugs in my CBOW implementation. I will definitely spend more time on my research in the next two weeks.

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
No revisions expected.

## Resources Needed
For now, I have all the resources I need.
