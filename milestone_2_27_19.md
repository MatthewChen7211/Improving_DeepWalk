## Major Changes
No major changes expected.

## What I Have Accomplished
I have fixed the issues in the test script and tested my code on the Facebook dataset. The CBOW model is faster than the Skip-gram model but has worse accuracy. The improvement in speed is expected because CBOW has smaller complexity. The sacrifice in performance is somewhat expected because the relation between nodes in graphs is closer to semantics than to syntax in natural languages.

## Meeting My Milestone
I have met my milestone.

## Surprises
No surprises encountered.

## Looking Ahead
I will perform a more detailed comparison between CBOW and Skip-gram by testing them on more datasets under different conditions. I will try other methods to improve DeepWalk such as negative sampling and different loss functions.

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
No revisions expected.

## Resources Needed
For now, I have all the resources I need.
